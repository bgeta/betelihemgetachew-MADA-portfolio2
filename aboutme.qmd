# ***Short Bio***

I am a public health professional with years of experience on Tobacco Control both nationally and Globally. I am currently pursuing my DrPH and preparing to write my dissertation. I am hopeful this course will help me get organized and support my data anaysis skill for my dissertation and beyond.

## *Data Analysis and software experiences*

At different points in my career I have used some SAS, SPSS and STATA, some more than others. I am very new to all these modern applications especially GitHub and Quarto and I can't say I am not intimidated.

In my quest to understand this very first module, I found a youtube video that was very useful to me, hope it can be useful to you too!

### Interesting Personal Fact 

Well, maybe, not so interesting but I think in Amharic (the official language for Ethiopia) and speak in English. Its very hard!

I look forward to engaging, learning and working with you all!
