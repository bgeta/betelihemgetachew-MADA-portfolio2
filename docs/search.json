I am hopeful this course will help me get organized and support my data anaysis skill for my dissertation and beyond.\n\n\nAt different points in my career I have used some SAS, SPSS and STATA, some more than others. I am very new to all these modern applications especially GitHub and Quarto and I canâ€™t say I am not intimidated.\nIn my quest to understand this very first module, I found a youtube video that was very useful to me, hope it can be useful to you too!\nCreating Rich Content in Quarto\n\n\nWell, maybe, not so interesting but I think in Amharic (the official language for Ethiopia) and speak in English. Its very hard!\nI look forward to engaging, learning and working with you all!"
