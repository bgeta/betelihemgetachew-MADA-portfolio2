This visualization excercise was conducted to replicate the line chart published on [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-52-best-and-weirdest-charts-we-made-in-2016/) in the year 2016. The chart is call "On duty police officer deaths in the U.S. By Cause". The data source for this chart was from the [Officer Down Memorial Page(ODMP)](https://www.odmp.org/). In trying to access the website for this particular dataset, I was only able to get annual fallen officer statistics rather than an aggregate data beginning in 1700's as depicted on the fivethirtyeightwebiste. Alternativly, I was able to look through statista [U.S. law enforcement deaths 1786-2022, by cause \| Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1070627/us-law-enforcement-deaths-by-cause-historical/#:~:text=Jun%2021%2C%202022%20Since%20the%201780s%2C%20over%2025%2C000,law%20enforcement%20deaths%20recorded%2C%20particularly%20before%20the%201930s.) which also used ODMP data, and found an aggregate dataset from the 1700's to 2020. The only difference was that the data in statista focused on four major catagories and also added COVID as a new category. The below figure show teh chart I will attempt to replicate in this exercise.

**Data import and cleaning**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load a few R packages
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(skimr)
library(haven)
library(memisc)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
lawdata<-read.csv(here("data/lawenforcementdata.csv"))
```

Data summary. The available data begins from the year 1786 to 2022 and cause of death includes Gunfire, Assault/Stabbing, 9/11 and related illness, COVID and other.

```{r}
message=FALSE
summary(lawdata)
```

#changing my dataset from wide to long

```{r}
data_long1<-melt(lawdata, id.vars=c("Year"))
```

```{r}
data_long1
```

```{r}
complete.cases(data_long1) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data_long1,aes(x=Year,y=value, fill=variable))+geom_area()+
ggtitle("On-duty police officer in the U.S. 
By cause since 1786") + theme(legend.position=c(.25,.75))
```

#I tried adding the theme_fivethirtyeight to match the aesthetics but it doesnt look like it worked. The code I used to remove the legend title variable didnt seem to work either. ggplot(data_long1,aes(x=Year,y=value, fill=variable))+geom_area()+ ggtitle("On-duty police officer in the U.S. By cause since 1786") + theme(legend.position=c(.25,.75)) + theme(legend.title=element_blank()+ theme_fivethirtyeight())+ annotate(geom="text",x=2001,y=72, label ="72 police officeres died in the 9/11terrorist attack", hjust="top")

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

This was a very useful exercise. The most important thing I learned was the importance of the data structure and how it needs to be manipulated to fit into a data structure (wide or long) in order for it to be compatible with the chart type you are using. Finding the specific color codes and background shades was very challenging. I did try to use theme_fivethirtyeight get the overall colors and themes to match but it doesn't look like it worked.
